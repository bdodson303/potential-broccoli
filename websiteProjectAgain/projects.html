        <p>This project I did a while back and had a lot of fun building it. The idea of the project was just to have a functional stock portfolio desktop app with some features I liked. For example showing your total return and total percentage return.</p>
        <div id="portfolioImageDiv">
            <img src="imgs/portfolioImage.PNG" id="portfolioImage"><br>
            <input type='button' id="changeImage" value="Change Image">
        </div>
        <p>The app lets you add and delete stocks easily and input at what price you bought them at. Furthermore, the program calculates your total account balance every time you refresh or open the program.</p>
        <p>Another feature I added was stock graphing with matplotlib finance which allows you to see some cool customizable candlestick charts which you can see if you press the button below the image.</p>

        <p>This project I worked on much more recently and was a demo I built for a company named Greenhill. Greenhill has a young adults program that involves a work book where the kids do sections then have it signed of by the adults. Greenhill asked me if I could come up with a demo phone application for this.</p>
        <div id="ghAppImgDiv">
            <img src="imgs/LoginScreen.PNG" id="ghillAppImage"><br>
            <input type='button' id="backButton" value="Back">
            <input type='button' id="nextButton" value="Next">
        </div>
        <p>The idea behind the app is the kids would be able to complete readings anwser prompt questions and take quizes all from there phone and that data could then be sent to one of the staff members there for review.</p>
        <p>I built this demo app with a python module called kivy and really enjoyed putting it together.</p>
